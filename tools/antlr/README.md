[ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is used to generate the expression parser code. It is needed only to compile the source code.

[Download the ANTLR jar file](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) and put it in this folder.

If you're not using version 4.9 of ANTLR, then you will need to modify [GenerateParser.bat](../../src/OptionExpressions/GenerateParser.bat) to point to the correct jar file here.
